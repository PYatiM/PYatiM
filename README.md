# P Yati M 

I like breaking things, fixing them, and then building them stronger.
Mostly working around **security, systems, and weird low-level stuff**. If something behaves unexpectedly, I probably want to understand why.
More projects are on the way — I keep building and pushing as I go.

## Things I’ve Built (or building)

**Secure API Gateway (ongoing)**
Trying to make a gateway that actually *defends*, not just routes.

**Secure Sandbox Engine** (ongoing)
Experimenting with isolation, controlled execution, and containment.

**Custom Local Protocol**
Built my own packet + communication logic because… curiosity.

And various other projects..
